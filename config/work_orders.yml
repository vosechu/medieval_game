# This file describes the various kinds of work that take place in a
# village throughout the year, as well as what types of workers are
# needed to fulfill those tasks.

# Tasks that have a variable amount of work that scales by acres
#
# Calculation: acres / days_for_one_acre / people = `per_adult`
# Calculation: person_days = acres / `per_adult`
# Calculation: max_adults  = person_days
# Calculation: min_adults  = <Integer> # gathered from research
#
# Example: Given a 20 acre plot...
# acres_per_day:
#   # Broadcasting seeds   5 acres  / 1 day / 1 person = 5.0 ratio
#   per_adult: 5.0       # 20 acres / 5.0 ratio        = 4  person_days, min 1 person
#   min_adults: 1
#
#   # Plowing fields w/ ox 2 acres  / 1 day / 2 people = 1.0 ratio
#   per_adult: 1.0       # 20 acres / 1.0 ratio        = 20 person_days, min 2 people
#   min_adults: 2
#
#   # Harvesting hay       3 acres  / 1 day / 3 person = 1.0 ratio
#   per_adult: 1.0       # 20 acres / 1.0 ratio        = 20 person_days, min 3 people

#   # Harvesting grains    2 acres  / 1 day / 5 people = 0.4 ratio
#   per_adult: 0.4       # 20 acres / 0.4 ratio        = 50 person_days, min 5 people

# Tasks that have a variable amount of work that scales by amount of goods
#
# Calculation: person_days = units / `per_adult`
# Calculation: max_adults  = person_days
# Calculation: min_adults  = <Integer> # gathered from research
#
# Example: Given 300 units of grain would take 1 adult ~42 days
# units_processed_per_day:
#   per_adult: 7


# Tasks that have a fixed amount of work for a fixed number of days
#
# Calculation: max_adults  = person_days
# Calculation: min_adults  = <Integer> # gathered from research
#
# Example: ???
# fixed_per_day:
#   max_adults: 2
#   min_adults: 2
#   person_days: 20


# Tasks that require a percentage of the population for a number of days
# Calculation: person_days = population * required_days
# Calculation: max_adults  = population * percent_of_adults
# Calculation: min_adults  = max_adults
#
# Example: ???

  # and repairing roofs
  # May -  sheep cleaning and shearing,  planting and field maintenance
  # June - mowing hay crop and raking it into piles
  # July - harvest grains, bundle sheaves, weeding gardens
  # August - threshing and winnowing of grains, grinding of grains into flower
  # September - fruits picked and dried or stored, grapes picked and pressed
  # for juice and wine
  # October - gather nuts, roots, berries, and mushrooms, fields plowed and
  # empty fields sown with winter wheat, repairing and cleaning equipment.
  # November - firewood gathered, split, and stacked for themselves and the
  # lord, pigs and cows slaughtered and meat smoked,  flex and hemp processed
  # to make thread and rope

  # January: Clear ditches; cut wood; breed sows; spread manure; "camping"; early lambs born.
  # February: Prune grapes and fruit trees; prune and mend hedgerows; mend fences; kill moles; plant willow; add lime, chalk and manure to soil; lambing continues; calving begins.

  # May: Weed winter corn; remove moss from thatched roofs and repair; sow pulses; capture swarming bees; mark sheep; plant beets, carrots, cabbages, and other garden vegetables.
  # June: Wash and shear sheep; shear lambs later in the month; start mowing hay.
  # July: Keep mowing that hay; harvest flax and hemp; begin harvesting winter corn.
  # August: Finish harvesting winter grain, begin on spring grain; gather in straw; plant turnips.
  # September: Harvest peas; breed cattle; harvest honey; plow fields for winter grain; sow winter wheat and rye; harvest apples, blackberries; take excess stock to market.
  # October: Sow winter barley and oats; harvest grapes; make wine and verjuice; breed sheep; let pigs forage on acorns and beechnuts.
  # November: Unsuspecting pigs get fatter and fatter; take in firewood; threshing and winnowing continue through the winter.
  # December: Slaughter hogs; never too early to shovel manure; Merry Christmas!
